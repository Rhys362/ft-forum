# ft-forum
Forum built using php and mysql

In order to run this web application an AMP package such as WampServer or XAMPP running phpmyAdmin will need to be installed on the machine. Once an apache server with MySql is running, clone the code files and move the folder to the public access folder within the apache server program files, this could be called www, htdoc or sites depending on OS in use.

Once the code files are inside the public access folder, the application can now be accessed through the locally installed apache server by typing 'http://localhost/forum/index.php' into the browser, in order to use the application without errors, set up the neccessary tables in MySql.
